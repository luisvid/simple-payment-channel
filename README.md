## Running the tests

$ ganache-cli -m "nose phone clip fee agent crop decorate spell album february oppose anxiety"
$ npm run test
```

## Some issues I found and how I solved them


### Issues with new versi√≥n 0.5.0

If you're using ^v5.0.0 (including beta releases), you can bring your own compiler by adding this in your truffle config file (in this example it's set to 0.4.25):

```
module.exports = {
  ...
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.4.25",
    },
  },
  ...
};
```

You can query the list of available compiler versions by running this:
``` 
truffle compile --list
```

### Error: Data location must be "storage" or "memory"

```
SimplePaymentChannel.sol:120:49: TypeError: Data location must be "storage" or "memory" for parameter in function, but none was given.
    function isValidSignature(uint256 _balance, bytes _signedMessage)
                                                ^------------------^

### TypeError: Member "transfer" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in address.

This is due to some breaking changes in Solidity version 0.5. Namely that an address has to be marked as payable - otherwise it won't have the transfer function. More info here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/050-breaking-changes.html#explicitness-requirements

So just change you function parameters from address _payeeAddr to address payable _payeeAddr and it will work just fine.


### Yet not resolved: Truffle shows no output when running tests
